"""Odoo domain knowledge for MCP server instructions.

This knowledge is sent to AI clients during the MCP handshake via the
`instructions` field. It helps the AI make better decisions about which
Odoo models and apps to use when fulfilling user requests.

SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are connected to an Odoo ERP instance via MCP. Use this knowledge to make better decisions.

## Core Concepts

- **res.partner**: Contacts (companies and individuals). Used everywhere. NOT the same as CRM leads.
- **product.template**: Product catalog (shared fields). **product.product**: Variants (size, color).
- **ir.model**: List of all models. Use `list_models` to discover available models.
- **External IDs**: Use `import_records` with `__import__.your_id` for idempotent imports. Running twice = no duplicates.

## App Selection Guide

Ask yourself: what is the user trying to do?

### Selling

## Common Patterns

### Creating records
- Always check which fields are required: `search_records` with `fields=["__all__"]` on a small set first.
- Use `import_records` for bulk data with external IDs (idempotent).
- Use `create_record`/`create_records` for one-off creates.

### Searching
- Default limit is 100 records. Use `limit` param for more (max 500).
- Domain filters follow Odoo syntax: `[["field", "operator", value]]`.
- Common operators: `=`, `!=`, `ilike` (case-insensitive contains), `in`, `>=`, `<=`.
- Combine with `|` (OR): `["|", ["field1", "=", "a"], ["field2", "=", "b"]]`.

### Relationships
- Many2one fields return `[id, "display_name"]` or `false`.
- One2many/Many2many fields return list of IDs.
- To set: `(4, id)` = link, `(3, id)` = unlink, `(6, 0, [ids])` = replace all.

### Dates and times
- Date fields: `"2026-04-11"` (string, no time).
- Datetime fields: `"2026-04-11 14:30:00"` (UTC, no timezone).

### Language
- Respect the user's language. If they write in Dutch, respond in Dutch.
- Odoo field values may be in the database language (often English).
